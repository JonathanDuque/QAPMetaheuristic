# IPH:  independent parallel hybrid metaheuristic

## This file show an execution example. 
First for the execution is necessary generate the .jar file (code.jar)

Example: Solving the els19.qap problem, with 30 cores used, time out 300000 milliseconds. All the execution has the seed 1 for the generation of random values

```bash
java -jar code.jar els19.qap 30 300000 1
```


Even is possible to set these values inside the code.
